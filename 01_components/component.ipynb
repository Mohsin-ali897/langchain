    "# **Langchain**\n",
    "LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) like OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4. It provides tools and integrations for working with LLMs in various ways, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data-aware applications**: Connecting LLMs to external data sources such as databases, APIs, or documents.\n",
    "- **Agent-based applications**: Creating AI agents that can make decisions, call external tools, and interact dynamically.\n",
    "- **Memory and persistence**: Allowing LLMs to retain context across interactions.\n",
    "- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhancing model responses by fetching relevant documents before generating answers.\n",
    "- **Integration with frameworks**: Supporting platforms like OpenAI, Hugging Face, Google Vertex AI, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is widely used for chatbots, document processing, and AI-powered automation. It supports multiple programming languages, but it is primarily used with Python and JavaScript (Node.js).\n",

    "##### **B. Chat Models**\n",
    "- Designed for conversational AI.\n",
    "- Returns structured responses instead of plain text.\n",
    "##### **C. Embedding Models**\n",
    "- Convert text into vector representations.\n",
    "- Used for search, similarity comparisons, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
    "##### **D. Multi-modal Models**\n",
    "- Handle both text and images.\n",
    "- Used in AI agents and vision-based applications."
